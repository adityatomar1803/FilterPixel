This app is build using Django, and vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Tips to get started: 

1. Clone the project
2. (optional) Install virtual env and activate it.
3. Install all the dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file
4. Start the server

Note::: I have purposely kept all my secrets exposed for your convenience. You do not need to enter any of your own api credentials for 
testing this app.

--> After you have successfully started the server, you can sign in via google OR you can go to the django admin interface and create a 
new user and then proceed to login with the newly created user.

--> Upon login, you will see the fetched images and as you scroll to the bottom, more images will appear on the webpage(infinite scrolling). 
Note::: the infinite scrolling effect can be obscure in the S3 case as the images are so small, but the effect will be clearly visible when
try it with google drive section.

once satisfied, you can safely logout from the webapp.
Happy Coding!
